These things are related. The root cause is a system that takes housing, a human right, and exploits it for profit.\nDespite my newfound status as a property owner, I have a lot more in common with the average Minneapolis renter than I do with landlords. That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m providing a dataset to other renters and advocacy groups that makes it a lot easier to find out who owns rental properties in your neighborhood.\nWhat follows is a back of napkin analysis underpinned by a (much more valuable) public dataset of Minneapolis landlords from 2020, which I\u0026rsquo;ve put a LOT of time into cleaning and normalizing.\nRead on and then VOTE YES ON 3.\nFighting the \u0026ldquo;LLC problem\u0026rdquo; through data munging Inspiration for this project comes from Find My Landlord website, which aims to connect Chicago landlords to the shell companies and LLCs they use to avoid liability and, in some cases, accountability.\nAs that project so expertly illustrates, there\u0026rsquo;s a well known \u0026ldquo;LLC problem\u0026rdquo; among housing advocates who want to learn who owns a building. Individuals and corporations that own many buildings at once tend to protect their assets by creating different LLCs for each building they own, so if they get sued, only that building is \u0026ldquo;in danger\u0026rdquo;. They sometimes even file taxes under multiple business names in order to obsfucate the fact that they own multiple rental properties. (Read on for an example of this in action.)\nTo help local housing advocates overcome the LLC problem, I decided to do some hard-core data munging. I downloaded Assessor Parcel data for 2020 from the Open Minneapolis portal. This file lists the owners, taxpayers, value, and characteristics of all Minneapolis parcels and buildings.\nI cleaned the hell out of the data and then applied some techniques* in Open Refine to find common owners of residential rental properties that were registered to many different LLCs and, in some cases, family members. I also ran an analysis on the results, which I share the headline findings of below.\nDisclaimer: This data was manually reviewed and cleaned to the best of my ability. There may be mistakes and/or omissions.\nWhat the data reveals One in five single family Minneapolis homes is rented for profit Of the 74,689 single-family homes in Minneapolis, 13,572 are rental properties. 2,545 of these rental properties are owned by what I\u0026rsquo;ll call \u0026ldquo;corporate landlords\u0026rdquo;—those who own four or more rental properties, who make their living off of renters. These are properties that could otherwise be on the market for would-be buyers who are having a hell of a time finding houses, especially lower-income buyers who are currently priced out of the market.\nMinneapolis landlords are hiding their identities to an alarming extent There are 852 Minneapolis landlords who have registered their properties to multiple aliases: 2,961 third-parties (typically LLCs and family members) total or 3.5 aliases per owner on average, in many cases hiding their ownership from tenants.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of this trickery in action—many different LLCs registered to a single family of rental property owners:\n   This purposeful obsfucation makes it difficult for tenants to hold owners accountable. How is this legal?\nPrivate equity and local profiteers are making a killing on Minneapolis renters Collectively, Minneapolis landlords collect rent on 114,203 rental units across the city. With an average rent of $1,455, that\u0026rsquo;s a whopping $166 million exiting renters pockets each month and going to landlords, rather than one\u0026rsquo;s own mortgage.\nThe top twenty landlords (by number of properties owned) collectively own over 1,600 rental properties in Minneapolis.\n   Though some of the top property owners are nonprofits like Project for Pride in Living, more often they are companies like Front Yard Residential Corporation and investment funds like Carpathain Capital Management. Not exactly the picture of \u0026ldquo;mom and pop\u0026rdquo; landlords that the industry would have you believe. Definitely not who I\u0026rsquo;d want as a landlord.\nThe working class can\u0026rsquo;t build wealth if Minneapolis landlords own all the property Home ownership is an excellent way for families to build wealth. Disparities in wealth along racial lines are often tied to similar disparities in homeownership rates, which in Minneapolis were historically caused by racist redlining practices.\nWith that in mind, consider this: Minneapolis landlords own rental properties worth more than $19 billion dollars (as valued by the city\u0026rsquo;s assessor office). Imagine if some of those properties could be owned by families instead! It could go a long way towards addressing inequity.\n\u0026ldquo;Mom and pop\u0026rdquo; landlords shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be let off the hook 11,027 single family homes that could otherwise be owned by their residents are instead owned by so-called \u0026ldquo;mom and pop\u0026rdquo; landlords that own three or fewer properties. Only 39 of these single family homes are arguably truly mom and pop-owned—that is, rented out by someone who also lives on the property.\nVote Yes on 3 - Rent Control for Minneapolis Minneapolis heads to the polls next Tuesday, November 2 to decide on rent control and other important ballot questions.\nWe know that rent control works. We just need voters to support the measure at the ballot box.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re as frustrated as I am by the extent to which landlords are winning out over the rest of us, go vote.\nSame day voter registration is available, as is early voting. Check out the Election Links at the top of the Star Tribune\u0026rsquo;s election guide for info on registration, finding your polling place, and more.\nDig into the data I\u0026rsquo;ve archived on Github a derivative of the 2020 Minneapolis Assessor Parcel dataset that includes rental properties, their likely owners, and the aliases they use. You can download it as a spreadsheet by following this link. You can also search for owners of a particular address or alias in this dashboard.\n var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1635431707746'); var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0]; if ( divElement.offsetWidth  800 ) { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth  500 ) { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='1227px';} var scriptElement = document.createElement('script'); scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'; vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);  I\u0026rsquo;ve removed owners' addresses from the dataset because doxxing is bad karma. If you need to find contact information for a specific LLC that owns a rental property in order to advocate for yourself or others, OpenCorporates is a great resource. The source dataset also includes a wealth of information on specific properties. Use this information responsibly.\nAs I mention above, I make no promises to the accuracy of the data, though I\u0026rsquo;ve tried my best. Caveat emptor.\nThe data (as well as my analyses above) includes nonprofit owners of rental properties, as well as \u0026ldquo;mom and pop\u0026rdquo; landlords and some co-ops. Public housing has been removed from the dataset (though it\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that only a fraction of rental units (5,700) are city or county owned).\nFor more info on my analysis of the landlord data, visit Github.\n* Revealing my techniques publicly could help shifty landlords hide their identities better in the future. I\u0026rsquo;m happy to share them privately, though! Get in touch via email if you\u0026rsquo;re a housing advocate who wants to learn more.\n","date":1635379237,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635379237,"objectID":"cafe1c2cbd75abce9d5e9a5fe790dc95","permalink":"https://skonkiel.github.io/minneapolis-landlords/","publishdate":"2021-10-28T00:00:37Z","relpermalink":"/minneapolis-landlords/","section":"post","summary":"Download the 2020 Minneapolis landlord dataset: properties owned, aliases, valuation, and more Searchable landlord dashboard: Search based on owner name, alias, and address Minneapolis landlord analysis: Dig into my analysis Vote yes on 3, yes on rent control for Minneapolis on November 2  Homeownership is increasingly out of reach for the average Minnesotan, especially in Minneapolis, where one in five single family homes is rented for profit.","tags":null,"title":"Minneapolis landlord dataset and dashboard","type":"post"},{"authors":["Stacy Konkiel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1612137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612137600,"objectID":"41770564e2597aa0fd7f682b04438ef9","permalink":"https://skonkiel.github.io/project/mn-wind-power/","publishdate":"2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mn-wind-power/","section":"project","summary":"A Tableau dashboard that explores the state's most-used renewable energy source and maps strategic opportunities.","tags":[],"title":"Minnesota Wind Power","type":"project"},{"authors":["Nicky Agate","Rebecca Kennison","Stacy Konkiel","Christopher P.

I\u0026rsquo;m reposting the blog post here under a CC-BY license.\nRecently on the LIS-Bibliometrics listserv, Ruth Harrison (Imperial College London) posed a question on behalf of a patron who was interested in identifying authors' genders based upon names listed on ~2,000 journal articles–too large a corpus for manual analysis. The community weighed in with many good suggestions for ways to approach a large scale gender analysis for author names. We thought it would be helpful to others to share what Ruth learned (with permission from the original posters).\nHere are some recommendations from LIS-Bibliometrics listserv members on the best places to find author names, APIs and software you can use to analyze gender, consultants you can hire the analysis out to, and previous approaches to analysis from other gender bibliometrics researchers.\nWhere to find author names lists Web of Science was most recommended as being a good way to download full author names for publication lists. Programmatic access via the Web of Science API is usually available for licensing (libraries are usually the purchasers of Web of Science access for institutions, so you should contact your library to inquire as to whether API access is included in your institution\u0026rsquo;s contract).\n We would be remiss if we did not point out the challenges that face anyone seeking to do a study that determines a person\u0026rsquo;s gender, based on name alone.\n New citation index Dimensions also makes authors' full names available for download (though only for up to 50 papers at once in the free version of the app) and via the Dimensions API, which is freely available for those doing scientometrics research.\nOn the other hand, listserv members pointed out that Scopus only makes authors' first initials available both in metadata downloads for publication lists and via the Scopus API. Therefore, it is unsuitable to use in isolation for finding author names.\nAPIs and software Automated gender analysis requires a bit of programming knowledge (or at least a willingness to learn). In particular, calling APIs and parsing publication metadata are two essential programming skills.\nGender API is a recommended service that allows you to look up the likely gender (and degree of confidence) for a particular name or list of names. For example, you could query the name \u0026ldquo;Diana\u0026rdquo; and learn that the name is classified as \u0026lsquo;female\u0026rsquo;, with a 93% accuracy rate based on a sample of 523 names. The providers offer clients for interacting with the API in PHP, Python, and several other programming languages.\nNamsor is another recommended API for looking up gender based on names, and it has the added feature of looking up ethnicity, as well. The free API allows for a limited number of monthly calls; you can also pay for API access to increase your API call limit.\nGenderChecker is a recommended name list that can be downloaded for less than $200 USD, then analyzed. As one listserv poster explained, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not 100 percent accurate, but works for most American/European first names, especially if you have a large dataset. Be very careful with Chinese/Japanese/Korean names; most of the time they should be neutral unless you further checked.\u0026rdquo;\nGenderize.io is yet another API that was not recommended by listserv members, but appears in several recent studies and reports. The Genderize database reportedly contains 216,286 distinct names across 79 countries and 89 languages. It is free to use but rate-limited to 1000 requests per day.\nFinally, the recommended Python package SexMachine allows you to look up the gender for around 40,000 names. For each name you query, you will get a response for one of the following categories: andy (androgynous), male, female, mostly_male, or mostly_female. For example, the query \u0026ldquo;Paul\u0026rdquo; would return \u0026ldquo;male\u0026rdquo;, whereas the name \u0026ldquo;Stacy\u0026rdquo; would return \u0026ldquo;mostly_female\u0026rdquo;.\nOther gender researchers' approaches Listserv members also suggested that Ruth and her patron look to existing author gender analysis studies to find methods to borrow. Two in particular–a 2013 commentary from Nature, and a more recent Elsevier report–were the most mentioned:\n Larivière, V., Ni, C., Gingras, Y., Cronin, B., \u0026amp; Sugimoto, C. R. (2013). Bibliometrics: Global gender disparities in science. Nature, 504(7479), 211. (2017). Gender in the global research landscape.  The Nature study\u0026rsquo;s supplementary files include a thorough discussion of how to parse Web of Science names data for a variety of countries of origin.\nOne listserv respondent pointed out that \u0026ldquo;The Elsevier report\u0026rsquo;s methodology implies they didn\u0026rsquo;t have an easier way to [identify author gender] (\u0026ldquo;Scopus Author Profiles were combined with gender-name data from social media, applied onomastics, and Wikipedia\u0026rdquo;).\u0026rdquo; More details on the study\u0026rsquo;s methods can be found in a report appendix. Particularly useful is a discussion of the various name-gender APIs suitability for multi-country analysis.\nConsultants For those who want to hire out the work, Science-Metrix, Elsevier Analytical Services, and Digital Science Consultancy are all businesses that offer a variety of bibliometrics analysis services, which may include gender analysis. Contact the consultancies themselves for more information.\nChallenges We would be remiss if we did not point out the challenges that face anyone seeking to do a study that determines a person\u0026rsquo;s gender, based on name alone. First and foremost, there is the question of ethics: does this kind of study rob authors of their right to be identified as a particular gender that might not match the expected gender for someone with their name?\nRelated to that issue is the problem of the assumption of a gender binary. All studies in this area tend to identify authors as \u0026ldquo;Male\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Female\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Unisex\u0026rdquo; (as in, a name that is suitable for both men and women), and \u0026ldquo;Unknown\u0026rdquo;. How can researchers more accurately identify the gender of someone who identifies as genderqueer or agender, for example? It doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem possible to do so using a simple names analysis, meaning that these kinds of studies should be approached and described with that caveat in mind.\nThen there are technical issues related to the dearth of useful author metadata and regional name-gender data. \u0026ldquo;What about cases where the author info only includes initials?\u0026rdquo; one listserv respondent wrote. Other respondents pointed out that many name-gender analysis tools are biased towards Western names, making it difficult to do accurate analysis on authors from other areas of the world.\n","date":1604699497,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604699497,"objectID":"07e7393807fb74db1c143dd7b7ac685f","permalink":"https://skonkiel.github.io/identify-author-gender-data-analysis/","publishdate":"2020-11-06T21:51:37Z","relpermalink":"/identify-author-gender-data-analysis/","section":"post","summary":"In 2018, I wrote a post for The Bibliomagician blog on identifying authors' genders based on name analyses, based on a lively discussion on the LIS-Bibliometrics listserv.

This paper aims to look at bibliometrics and altmetrics for New Zealand research published in 2016 to understand the country’s research’s reach in social media, mainstream media and public policy, as well as more traditional measures of research impact such as university rankings, citations and publications. Design/methodology/approach Research insights platform Dimensions was searched for author affiliations and publication dates for papers published in 2016 by New Zealand researchers (n = 10,934). The study then used Dimensions to perform citation analysis and Altmetric Explorer to find altmetrics for these journal articles, and to generate visualizations to better interrogate the data set. Findings Of the 10,934 papers published in 2016 by New Zealand (2016 NZ) researchers, 5,413 (49.5 per cent) were mentioned 86,915 times in one of the 16 sources that Altmetric tracks. Twitter, news outlets and Facebook were among the sources that showed the most engagement with New Zealand 2016 research. Citation analysis tools in Dimensions showed that New Zealand 2016 research had a higher than average Field Citation Ratio (1.51) and Relative Citation Ratio (1.29). Originality/value This study combines traditional bibliometric analysis with altmetrics to find new insights into the impact of recent New Zealand research. It suggests new means for organizations to demonstrate the value of the research they produce.","tags":["Bibliometrics","Citation analysis","Altmetrics","Altmetric","Dimensions","New Zealand"],"title":"Altmetrics: “big data” that map the influence of New Zealand research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joshua Finnell","Stacy Konkiel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1506816000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506816000,"objectID":"3a80a1e83b13de652f18832bb519f2fa","permalink":"https://skonkiel.github.io/publication/finnell-building-2017/","publishdate":"2020-04-12T22:26:37.927021Z","relpermalink":"/publication/finnell-building-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"This article is on overview of Library Pipeline, a grassroots library organization dedicated to supporting structural changes by providing opportunities, funding, and services that improve the library as an institution and librarianship as a profession.","tags":["innovation","Grants","library associations","nonprofits"],"title":"Building and Sustaining a Grassroots Library Organization: A Three-Year Retrospective of Library Pipeline","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Work \u0026 Research"],"content":"CC-BY Nicky Agate / Medium I’m excited to announce that the HuMetricsHSS research team–which I was a part of at the 2016 TriangleSCI conference–has received the support of the Andrew W.

(Keep an eye out for the resulting blog post and handout on Altmetric.com–I think they’re going to be good!)\nAltmetrics and P\u0026amp;T is a topic that’s come up a lot recently, and predictably the responses are usually one of the following:\n Do you seriously want to give people tenure based on their number of Twitter followers?!!?! ::rageface:: Hmm, that’s a pretty interesting idea! If applied correctly (i.e. in tandem with expert peer review and traditional metrics like citation counts, etc), I could see how altmetrics could improve the evaluation process for P\u0026amp;T.  You can probably guess how I lean.\nWith that in mind, I wanted to think aloud about an editorial I recently read in Inside Higher Ed (a bit late to the game–the essay was written in 2014). It’s a great summary of many of the issues that plague P\u0026amp;T here in the States, and in particular the bits about “legitimacy markers” make a great argument in favor of recognizing altmetrics in P\u0026amp;T evaluation and preparation guidelines.\nBelow, I’ve excerpted the parts [to which I want to respond] (and the bits I want to emphasize), but please visit Inside Higher Ed and read the piece in its entirety, it’s worth your time.\nThe assumption that we know a scholar’s work is excellent if it has been recognized by a very narrow set of legitimacy markers adds bias to the process and works against recognition of newer form of scholarship. [\u0026#8230;] Typically candidates for tenure and promotion submit a personal narrative describing their research, a description of the circulation, acceptance rate and impact factors of the journals or press where they published, a count and list of their citations, and material on external grants. This model of demonstration of impact favors certain disciplines over others, disciplinary as opposed to interdisciplinary work, and scholarship whose main purpose is to add to academic knowledge. [Emphasis mine.] In my view, the problem is not that using citation counts and journal impact factors is “a” way to document the quantity and quality of one’s scholarship. The problem is that it has been normalized as the only way. All other efforts to document scholarship and contributions \u0026#8212; whether they be for interdisciplinary work, work using critical race theory or feminist theory, qualitative analysis, digital media or policy analysis are then suspect, marginalized, and less than. Using the prestige of academic book presses, citation counts and federal research awards to judge the quality of scholarship whose purpose is to directly engage with communities and public problems misses the point. Interdisciplinary and engaged work on health equity should be measured by its ability to affect how doctors act and think. [One might argue that altmetrics like citations in public policy documents and clinical care guidelines are a good proxy for this.] Research on affirmative action in college admissions should begin to shape admissions policies. [Perhaps such evidence could be sourced from press releases and mainstream media coverage of said changes in admissions policies.] One may find key theoretical and research pieces in these areas published in top tier journals and cited in the Web of Science, but they should also find them in policy reports cited at NIH [again, citations in policy docs useful here], or used by a local hospital board to reform doctor training [mining training handbooks and relevant websites could help locate such evidence]. We should not be afraid to look for impact of scholarship there, or give that evidence credibility. Work that is addressing contemporary social problems deserves to be evaluated by criteria better suited to its purposes and not relegated to the back seat behind basic or traditional scholarship. Altmetrics technologies aren’t yet advanced enough to do most of the things I’ve suggested above (in particular, to mine news coverage or the larger Web for mentions of the effects of research, rather than links to research articles themselves). But the field is very young, and I expect we’ll get there soon enough. And in the meantime, we’ve got some pretty decent proxies for true impact already in the main altmetrics services (i.e. policy citations in Altmetric Explorer, clinical citations in PlumX, dependency PageRank for useful software projects in Depsy/Impactstory).\nIn the shorter term, we need for academics to advocate for the inclusion of altmetrics in promotion \u0026amp; tenure evaluation and preparation guidelines.\nMost researchers don’t know that this data is available, so they tend not to use it in preparing their dossiers. Fair enough.\nWhat concerns me are the researchers who are aware of altmetrics, but who are hesitant to include it in their dossiers for fear that their colleagues a) won’t know what to do with the data, or b) won’t take them seriously if they include it. After all, there’s a lot of misinformation out there about what altmetrics are meant to do, and if you’ve got a reviewer that’s misinformed or that has a bone to pick re: altmetrics, that could potentially affect your career.\nThen there’s the tenure committees, often made up of reviewers from all disciplines and at all (post-tenure) stages of their career. If they’re presented with altmetrics as evidence in a P\u0026amp;T dossier but a) they’re biased against altmetrics, and/or b) their university’s review guidelines don’t confirm that altmetrics–in the service of providing evidence for specific claims to impact–are a respectable form of evidence for one’s dossier, then the tenure applicant is either met with confusion or skepticism (at best) or responded to with outright hostility (at worst).\n(Before you think I’m being melodramatic re: “outright hostility”–you should see some of the anti-altmetrics diatribes out there. As in many other aspects of life, some people aren’t content with the “you do it your way, I’ll do it my way” thing–they are pissed that you dare to challenge the status quo and will attack those who suggest differently.)\nAnyone reading this post that’s got a modicum of influence at their university (i.e. you’ve got tenure status and/or voting rights on your university’s faculty council) should go and petition their vice provost of faculty affairs to update their university-wide P\u0026amp;T review and preparation guidelines to include altmetrics. Or, at the very least, focus on changing departmental/college P\u0026amp;T guidelines.\nOnce you’ve done so, we’re that much closer to reforming the P\u0026amp;T process to respect the good work that’s being done by all academics, not just those who meet a very traditional set of criteria.\n","date":1473200541,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1473200541,"objectID":"e43ee69ec94e43e664bf77f5e1a68022","permalink":"https://skonkiel.github.io/altmetrics-promotion-tenure/","publishdate":"2016-09-06T22:22:21Z","relpermalink":"/altmetrics-promotion-tenure/","section":"post","summary":"For the past few weeks, I’ve been working with a colleague at Altmetric to develop a guide for using altmetrics in one’s promotion and tenure dossier.

The Reddit Ask Me Anything forum is a great way to engage and interact with subject experts in a direct and honest Q\u0026A, asking those burning questions you’ve always wanted to get their perspective on! Mark Hahnel, the founder of Figshare, Euan Adie, the founder of Altmetric and John Hammersley, co-founder of Overleaf, have also all participated in this popular discussion forum.  Following their lead, on Tuesday 10th May at 6pm UK time / 1pm EST Stacy Konkiel, Altmetric’s Outreach \u0026 Engagement Manager, will be taking part in an AMA on the AskScience subreddit.   Stacy plans to talk about what the metrics and indicators we like to rely upon in science (impact factor, altmetrics, citation counts, etc) to understand “broader impact” and “intellectual merit,” are actually measuring what we purport they measure.  She is not sure they do! And instead thinks that right now, we’re just using rough proxies to understand influence and attention. We’re in danger of abusing the metrics that are supposed to save us all, altmetrics, just like science has done with the journal impact factor.  Stacy will talk about improving measures of research impact, but is also open to taking other relevant questions.  If you wish to participate in the Ask Me Anything, you will need to register with Reddit. There will also be some live tweeting from @altmetric and @digitalsci, and questions on the #AskStacyAltmetric hashtag, so keep your eyes peeled!

Now a new class of metrics—altmetrics—can help faculty pro- vide impact evidence that citation-based metrics might miss: for example, the influence of research on public policy or culture, the introduction of live-saving health interventions, and con- tributions to innovation and commercialization.

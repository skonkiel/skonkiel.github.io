 abstract = {Promotion and tenure decisions in the United States often rely on various scientometric indicators (e.g., citation counts and journal impact factors) as a proxy for research quality and impact. Now a new class of metrics—altmetrics—can help faculty pro- vide impact evidence that citation-based metrics might miss: for example, the influence of research on public policy or culture, the introduction of live-saving health interventions, and con- tributions to innovation and commercialization. But to do that, college and university faculty and administrators alike must take more nuanced, responsible, and informed approaches to using metrics},

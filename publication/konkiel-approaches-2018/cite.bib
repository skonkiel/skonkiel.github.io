 abstract = {There are many complexities and challenges associated with developing ‘humane’ research evaluation metrics in the humanities. This monumental task can only be addressed by reverse engineering evaluation metrics based upon the practices and values that funders, institutions, professional societies and individuals want to encourage in their disciplines. The work of the HuMetricsHSS initiative is described in this article as a framework for doing so.},
